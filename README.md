# BayesianAnalysis 📊

This repository contains Bayesian linear regression models built using **R** and **Stan**, developed as part of my coursework at **University College Dublin (UCD)**.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The objective is to predict **wine alcohol content** using different predictors like:
- Magnesium
- Color Intensity
- Proline

Three competing models are evaluated based on:
- WAIC
- LOO-CV
- Posterior Predictive Checks

## 🛠️ Tools & Packages
- R
- rstan
- loo
- bayesplot
- ggplot2

## 📁 Structure
- `Assignment1.qmd` – Simple linear regression with one predictor.
- `Assignment2.qmd` – Model selection with two predictors.
- `Assignment3.qmd` – Comparing multiple models with Stan.
- `Assignment4.qmd` – Final report with improvements based on feedback.

## 📌 Notes
All models use weakly informative priors. Posterior distributions are visualized and interpreted.
